Solutions to Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels
that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, 
university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving 
skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes 
in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

This are my solutions in which I will complete in a mixture of R, Python and Julia.

Advent of Code is made my [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). I am sure he would be happy if you supported him and Advent of Code which you can
